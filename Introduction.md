# Introduction
Who, what, where? Here!

# What is XPLORE?
XPLORE is a tabletop roleplaying game set in the far (alternate) future. Humanity and several other (alien) races have banded together to try and escape their dying galaxy. They work together in the XPLORE Initiative to try and find suitable planets to live on. Yet, by both choice and necessity they are forced to find a new home far from where they started. The players take on the role of elite specialists known as Explorers and are outfitted with the unique ROVER armor suit, a top of line spaceship and the hope of all sentient creatures back home.

# What's needed to play?
To play XPLORE you need little more than these rules, the provided player record sheets in the back and one or more sets of polyhedral dice.
Of course, having someone to play the game with is also handy. XPLORE can be played with at least one player taking up the role of storyteller and up to 5 players playing as Explorers.

The storyteller creates or follows a mission scenario and plays the role of the larger universe. They are both friend and foe that explorers meet, they narrate how the Explorers traverse strange alien worlds and how their efforts in combat, social situations or exploration develop.

Players embody their characters (Explorers) and go on mission scenarios to create new homes for their people, cull possible threats or make new alliances.  They work together with a crew of other players to be able to always overcome every challenge. They accept the call to adventure and are faced with situations that call on their expertise, their candour or sometimes just a lot of bullets.

Both the storyteller and the players use the polyhedral dice to decide the outcome of certain situations or actions. This could be a skill test to determine if they can interpret an alien language on an ancient console or an attack roll when they have to take down a threat. Failing a roll does not mean failure but instead should be interpreted as levels of success. The alien language might be unable to be translated fully and thus becomes a puzzle in and of itself. Similarly a threat might be too fast or well armoured to be taken down quickly, leading to a need for tactical insight or use of specific skills. 

XPLORE is not a play, itâ€™s a broad situation that reacts to player choices which enriches the story and makes the experience interactable.
